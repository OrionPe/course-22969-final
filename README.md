# course-22969-final

This repository contains the final project for Course 22969.

## Task 2 – GPT-2 From Scratch

Implementation of GPT-2 Medium (355M) from scratch in PyTorch.  
The trained model weights are saved locally after running Task 2.

## Task 3 – Chat Interface

Builds on the fine-tuned model from Task 2 and adds an interactive instruction-following chat interface.

**Important:**  
Model weights are not included due to GitHub size limitations.  
To run Task 3, first execute Task 2 to generate the required SFT weights.
